Program to disable the hardware prefetcher on various Intel processors.

Core2 uses 0x1a0 MSR, NHM and newer 0x1a4

Note, you need the msr kernel module installed ("modprobe msr")

If it still doesn't work, check dmesg.  Some recent distributions
are enabling the "kernel_lockdown" patch which prevents any access
to MSRs and this tool will not work.  There is no easy way to disable
this support without either recompiling your kernel or else disabling
efi-secureboot in your BIOS.
